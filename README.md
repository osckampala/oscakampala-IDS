## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher  
- `pip` package manager  
- Administrator/root privileges to capture network packets  
- Linux or Windows OS (Windows users: consider installing WinPcap/Npcap)

---

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oscakampala/OscaKampala_IDS.git
cd OscaKampala_IDS
````

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. (Optional) Adjust detection rules in `config/rules.yaml`.

---

### Usage

#### Run the IDS

Start network packet capture and detection:

```bash
python main.py
```

Alerts will be logged in `logs/alerts.log`.

#### Run the Dashboard

In a separate terminal:

```bash
cd dashboard
python app.py
```

Open your browser at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view live alerts.

---

## Customizing Rules

Detection rules are defined in `config/rules.yaml` with simple signature definitions. You can add your own rules using protocols, payload patterns, source/destination IPs, ports, and more. See existing rules for examples.
